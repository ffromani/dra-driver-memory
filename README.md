# dra-driver-memory

Kubernetes Device Resource Assignment (DRA) driver for memory and hugepages resources.

This repository implements a DRA driver that enables Kubernetes clusters to manage and assign CPU resources to workloads using the DRA framework.
In a nutshell, this is DRA-based a [memory manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/memory-manager/) replacement.
